# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-using-Python
Monte Carlo Simulation utilized in three cases;

Objectives;
> Explain the main concepts of Monte Carlo simulation
> Use historical observations to estimate the probability distributions of data
> Simulate many possible outcomes for independent variables using Python
> Summarize the distribution of scenarios using confidence intervals
> Interpret the output of Monte Carlo simulation results and use it to guide business decisions

Outcomes;
> Calculating daily returns from our observed data, we need to generate plausible scenarios to watch
the price evolve over a 250 day period.
> Since simple returns are not additive, we use log returns which later we reverse into simple returns after plotting graphs.
